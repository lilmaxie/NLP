    "### WORD EMBEDDINGS ###\n",
    "In NLP, word embeddings is a term used for the representation of words in a vector space. The idea is to represent words as vectors in a continuous vector space, where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points. This allows for the capture of semantic relationships between words, such as synonyms and antonyms, and can be used for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main types of word embeddings:\n",
    "1. **Count of frequency**: This method uses the frequency of words in a corpus to create a vector representation. The most common method is the **Bag of Words (BoW)** model, which creates a vector for each document based on the frequency of each word in the document. Another method is **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**, which takes into account the frequency of words in a document as well as their frequency across the entire corpus.\n",
    "2. **Deep learning**: This method uses neural networks to learn the vector representation of words. The most common methods are **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**. These methods use a large corpus of text to learn the relationships between words and create dense vector representations."

    "#### WORD2VEC ####\n",
    "- Word2Vec is a popular word embedding technique that uses a shallow neural network to learn the vector representation of words. It was developed by a team of researchers at Google led by Tomas Mikolov in 2013. Word2Vec uses two main architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram.\n",
    "    - **CBOW**: The CBOW model predicts the target word based on the context words surrounding it. It takes a set of context words as input and tries to predict the target word in the center. For example, given the context words \"the\", \"cat\", and \"sat\", the model would try to predict the target word \"on\".\n",
    "    - **Skip-Gram**: The Skip-Gram model does the opposite of CBOW. It takes a target word as input and tries to predict the context words surrounding it. For example, given the target word \"on\", the model would try to predict the context words \"the\", \"cat\", and \"sat\".\n",
    "- Word2Vec using cosine similarity to measure the similarity between two word vectors. Cosine similarity is a measure of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It is defined as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, which ranges from -1 to 1. A cosine similarity of 1 indicates that the two vectors are identical, while a cosine similarity of -1 indicates that they are completely dissimilar.\n",
    "- Word2Vec is trained using a large corpus of text, and the resulting word vectors can be used for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The word vectors can also be used to find similar words, perform analogies, and visualize the relationships between words in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "- Advantages of Word2Vec:\n",
    "    - Sparse matrix --> Dense matrix: Word2Vec creates dense vector representations of words, which are more efficient to store and process than sparse matrices.\n",
    "    - Semantic information is getting captured: Word2Vec captures the semantic relationships between words, allowing for the representation of synonyms and antonyms in the vector space.\n",
    "    - Vocab size --> fixed set of dimensions: Word2Vec creates a fixed-size vector representation for each word, which makes it easier to work with in machine learning models.\n",
    "    - Out of vocabulary words: Word2Vec can handle out-of-vocabulary words by using subword information, which allows for the representation of rare or unseen words in the vector space."

    "- Assume that we have a corpus: \"The cat sat on the mat\".\n",

    "    - The input to the CBOW model is the one-hot encoding of the context words, and the output is the one-hot encoding of the target word. The model learns to predict the target word based on the context words by adjusting the weights of the neural network during training.\n",
